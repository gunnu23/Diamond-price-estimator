    Diamond dimensions are the measurements used to describe the size and shape of a diamond:
    - **X (Length):** The longest dimension of the diamond, measured from end to end.
    - **Y (Width):** The second longest dimension, measured perpendicular to the length.
    - **Z (Depth):** The depth or height of the diamond, measured from the table (top) to the culet (bottom).

    The proportions of X, Y, and Z affect a diamond's appearance and quality:
    - **Ideal Proportions:** Well-balanced dimensions contribute to a diamond's brilliance and fire.
    - **Length-to-Width Ratio:** Influences the diamond's shape and visual appeal.
    - **Depth Percentage:** Affects how light interacts with the diamond, impacting its brilliance.
