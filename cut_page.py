    st.write("""
    The cut of a diamond is one of the most critical aspects influencing its beauty and value. The cut refers to how well the diamond has been shaped and faceted from its raw form. Unlike color and clarity, which are influenced by natural factors, the cut quality is determined by the skill and precision of the diamond cutter.

    - **Table Size:** The flat top surface of the diamond.
    - **Crown Angle:** The angle between the girdle (the widest part of the diamond) and the topmost surface (table).
    - **Pavilion Depth:** The distance from the girdle to the bottom tip (culet).
    - **Girdle Thickness:** The edge or the perimeter of the diamond.

    Diamond cuts are graded by laboratories such as the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). The grades range from Excellent to Poor:

    - **Excellent:** Reflects almost all light that enters the diamond, offering maximum brilliance and fire.
    - **Very Good:** Reflects most of the light, providing a high level of brilliance and fire.
    - **Good:** Reflects a considerable amount of light, but not as much as higher grades.
    - **Fair:** Reflects some light, but significant brilliance is lost.
    - **Poor:** Reflects very little light, resulting in a dull appearance.
